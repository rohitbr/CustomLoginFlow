The purpose of this project is to reflect how SwiftUI and Combine work together. It uses AWS Amplify service calls to make Signup, Login, Reset Password calls. It relies on AnyPublisher, CombineLatest, Future, Sink etc. 

This architecture followed is MVVM, I have used Codable for data models, views are designed by SwiftUI, viewModels contain all the business logic.
